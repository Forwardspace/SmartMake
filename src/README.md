# SmartMake
##### A smarter build system
---
Here is the simplest SmartMake script:
```
Build.
```
(in a file called ``SMakefile``, run it with ``smake``)
That's it. This will generate a basic Makefile for your source tree. However, SmartMake supports additional modifiers:
## Link
Adds a library switch to the compilation/link process, similar to adding ``-l<library_name_here>`` to your linker options.
```
Link <library_name_here>
Build.
```
## Project
Changes the name of the project, and thus the name of the intermediate and output files
```
Project ProjectNameHere
Build.
```

## About SmartMake
SmartMake is bootstrapped; the Makefile used to build it is generated by itself. There is a Makefile supplied with the source code, that has been generated by SmartMake. This can be used to build it and generate new Makefiles.
